# House_Prices-Advanced_Regression_Kaggle_Competition
## The main idea of this project is to predict the final price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa using Advanced regression techniques like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
# Project Overview:
## XGBRegressor model gave lowest mean_squared_error for the training data. Hence I chose this model to predict the SalePrice for the test data. The error score obtained for test data is 0.26.
